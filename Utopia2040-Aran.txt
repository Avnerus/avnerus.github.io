Utopia 2040
-----------
This is a story of a small town named Aran in the state of Gall, situated somewhere in the middle east, along the coast line of the Mediterranean. 
Aran's climate was warm and tropical, and its 300,000 citizens lived mainly in cool valleys that lay between the rocky but ever-green mountains.
Aran was also rich with oil, a resource that was running scarce across the planet. In fact, it was one of the richest concentrations of oil that remained untouched, because Aran's citizens were mainly working as web developers and graphic designers and were producing all of their energy using solar and wind power.
All in all, the town's inhabitants lived rather peacefully and had managed got avoid conflict was many years, until the year 2040.
While Aran didn't have much use for oil, the western world was consuming it more than ever, despite all warnings of pollution and climate change.
And indeed soon enough, the American and European delegates came knocking on the governor's door, barring fruit cakes and fat suitcases filled with dollars and euros.   
Gall’s ministers were mesmerized by the bills, and had no other option but to sell their oil resource to the west.
Within a couple of days, the city was invaded by a swarm of trucks and drills painted in red, white and blue, ready to suck this precious resource.
The trucks were a nuisance and noise pollution, but if that had been the only problem Aran was happily willing to close its eyes and plug its ears until their oil would too be depleted. Still the city was changing, with the oil came a new culture, new forms of employment, a stranger's economy, alienated production. But that wasn't the only problem that Aran had to face:
300km to the north, city called Due, took the role of the primary base of PAC, a dangerous militarist and fundamentalist terror organization. PAC was in fact started by a group of environmentalists and animal rights activists, who declared that the west was the destroyer of planet earth and an executer of genocide against its living population. For many years, the members of PAC believed they can save the planet by simply protesting, forming political parties and fighting for public opinion - But as society grew even more capitalist, one dimensional and manipulated by media, PAC decided to turn to what they thought was the only possible remaining solution - Violence.
Week after week, PAC grew stronger and became more violent. What started as guerrilla warfare and concise operations turned into an organised military.
The state of Gall however, never really needed a large army. It was a neutral state and had stable diplomatic relations with all of its neighbours. PAC took advantage of that, and with some acts of terror and intimidation they were able to overcome the government's defence and take complete control over the city of Due. Once the leaders of PAC heard about the capitalistic and oily invasion of the west into Aran, their next destination was clear.
Rada was at home, working on her computer, when the news broke in about PAC's invasion into Aran. All she could do was look out the window and watch the last moments of her calm life pass by, as the war vehicles pass by, baring PAC's logo of the green tree and crossed swords. Initially Rada hoped they would only disrupt the oil drilling, but this wasn't enough for the militants. They didn’t want just the oil field, they wanted to take control over the entire city.
At first they took hold of the city office and treasury, rerouting the taxes to their benefit. Rada could still maintain her job, but she would have to bare the fact that her tax money is being used for extreme violent purposes. Then they replaced the police on the streets, not being too violent towards the citizens, unless they noticed new sprouts of opposition. But it was when they took control over the media and the internet when Rada could really sense PAC's tight grip over her life.
She was losing the connection to her clients and stopped keeping track of the industry. Slowly she became totally disconnected from the outside world. 
Rada was starting to feel lost. Being constantly oppressed, it seemed that the only viable way to somewhat regain control of your life was to join the lines of PAC.
And she nearly did that, until one day she got her call from a Kan, a lifelong friend living a village 10km to the east whom she haven't talk to in a while.
Rada layed out all of her dilemmas and sorrows to Kan, about her thoughts of joining PAC. When Kan heard that he cut her off abruptly:
'Rada, you don't have to do this'. 'What do you mean?' she asked. 'Be at home at 8 in the evening he said, and get access to your roof. 
Rada got the key to the roof from her neighbours, and waited. At 20:00 Kan came, with a medium sized cardboard box. They went up to the roof and Kan opened the box. Inside it was an antenna like device:

"What is this?" Rada asked. "With this you can join my autonomy!", Kan said enthusiastically. "Autonomy address fdf8:f53b:82e4::53. Just point it in the direction of my house, and you're in." Rada was a bit confused.  "In what? What should I do once connected to your house?" , "Just live" he said. 
fdf8:f53b:82e4::53 Is not connected to the internet. When Rada connected to just one node, she became a part of a mesh network, with tens of thousands of nodes around the world, all connected with a chain of points.
This autonomy was just one out of thousands. There is a mesh network of communities, solidarity economies, running beneath and without the support of the old form of governments. And Rada didn't know a thing about it until she received that box.
The first ability that Rada regained was to make money so that she could get back on track. She started by designing web services for the autonomy. The autonomy had no banks and no central repository. It used a fair cryptocurrency framework which was completely transparent fraud proof for any use within the autonomy. For each design she was payed with this currently an amount that was set by the communities online voting system.
Once she got tired of designing services, all she had to do was look at the board for requested duties and see what she could do. She took some online teaching jobs, some research projects and later on started collaborating on art projects for the community. Every project had a price set by the community and was distributed equally between the collaborators. The community was enthusiastic about various subjects such as climate change, biodiversity and preservation of languages and cultures. Anything she could contribute to those fields awarded her the autonomy's currency. There were no stocks, no hierarchies and no advertisement. Everything was done on a project basis that was voted and streamlined through the needs and desires of the community.
The autonomy's currency was also designed to be sustainable. Any transaction that involved a natural resource was coupled with the current state of the resource that was constantly monitored. Community members were unable to utilize resoure beyond its sustainable limit.
After earning her weekly pay, she could easily convert it to Gall's currency so she could pay her rent and buy groceries. 
But the situation in Aran was getting worse. Living conditions started to become unbearable. It was even getting hard to get food on the city market.
But while Aran was sinking, the autonomy was flourishing. Through a great number of members around the globe, and through communication with other communities on the mesh, the autonomy started its own transportation system, made by the people of the communities. It was possible to deliver goods across the world. Rada could now buy food from the community but she could also get the knowledge and materials to produce her own.
Rada always had a view on the west as colonialist capitalist conglomerate of states, but she was amazed to find out that many of her autonomy members were from these states. She even collaborated with them on several projects.
Even though Rada had everything she needed, she still had no control over PAC roaming the streets, limiting her freedom. At one point she even posted a request on the community to help her relocate from Aran. She got several responses. The people could use laws in their own old-style government states, such as the law of marriage and of asylum seeking to relocate Rada. There were also people willing to help with the physical transition.
After giving it a lot of thought, Rada decided to go with a different strategy. Instead of running away, she will try to drain PAC of their most important resource. The human one. She began providing antennas to more and more people. In exchange, a member of the autonomy was assigned to be her personal bodyguard. 
It didn't long until even people in Due saw no reason to be a part of PAC.
By connecting to the mesh, each of the members found communities and autonomies with the values and interests they share. 
PAC had lost their appeal.
